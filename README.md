# BuildTracer

## About

BuildTracer is Movable Type template visualizer. It helps with the writing,
performance tuning, and analysis of MT templates. BuildTracer logs the rebuild
sequence of each MT generated page, visualizes the block structure of MT tags,
and shows how long each tag takes to publish in an individual template.

 * Visualize the block structure of MT tags

 * Display the current instance of an MT variable
 * Display the processing time of each sequence
